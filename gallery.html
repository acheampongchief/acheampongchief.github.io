     <p>I used freecodecamp to study responsive web design; studying html and css from the same module
      My experience has not been very easy.</p> 
      <p>It became somewwhat fustrating when the
        website doesnt accept your code.The errors the website gave me.
        Some of errors did not make sense since it just required some punctuations.
        some even required spaces between them.</p>
